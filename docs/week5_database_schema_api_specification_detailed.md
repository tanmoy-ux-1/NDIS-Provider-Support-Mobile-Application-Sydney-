# Week 5 – Database Schema and API Specification

## 1. Introduction
This section presents the **Week 5 deliverable** for the **Sydney NDIS Provider Mobile App (GridLink NDIS)**. The focus of this work is to design the **database schema**, define the **REST APIs**, specify the **validation rules**, and answer the core design questions required for backend implementation.

This deliverable provides the technical foundation for how the system stores data, manages relationships between records, exposes services to the frontend, and maintains data integrity and security.

---

## 2. Deliverable Overview
**Deliverable:** Database Schema and API Specification

This deliverable includes:
- Definition of the main system entities
- Relationships between entities
- Database structure and schema design
- REST API specification for major modules
- Validation rules for secure and accurate data entry
- Supporting diagrams to explain system design and flow

---

## 3. Objectives
The objectives of this section are to:
- Define the main data entities required by the system
- Show the relationships between those entities
- Design a backend data structure that supports core business operations
- Define REST APIs required by the mobile application
- Establish validation rules for correctness, security, and reliability
- Present diagrams that clearly explain the technical structure

---

## 4. Key Design Questions

### 4.1 What entities exist?
The system requires a set of entities to support provider operations, participant care management, scheduling, billing, communication, and compliance. The main entities identified are:

- Organisation
- Role
- User
- Participant
- Service Agreement
- Shift
- Progress Note
- Incident Report
- Invoice
- Funding Budget
- Notification
- Audit Log
- Consent Record

### 4.2 What relationships exist?
These entities are connected to support real-world operations in an NDIS provider environment. For example, one organisation manages many users and participants, one participant can have many shifts and progress notes, and one user may create multiple incident reports or invoices.

### 4.3 What APIs are required?
The application needs APIs for authentication, participant management, shift scheduling, care documentation, incident reporting, invoicing, notifications, reporting, and audit support.

---

# 5. Database Schema Design

## 5.1 Schema Design Approach
The database schema is designed using a **relational model** because the application contains structured data with clear links between users, participants, services, and records. A relational database such as **PostgreSQL** is appropriate because it supports:

- strong data consistency
- structured queries
- foreign key relationships
- transaction support
- scalability for future features

The schema is organised so that each major business object has its own table, with primary keys for identification and foreign keys for relationships.

---

## 5.2 Main Entities and Purpose

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Organisation | Stores provider organisation details |
| Role | Stores access roles such as Support Worker, Service Coordinator, Provider Administrator, and System Administrator |
| User | Stores staff and administrator account information |
| Participant | Stores participant personal and NDIS-related details |
| Service Agreement | Stores agreement details between provider and participant |
| Shift | Stores service schedule, assignments, and attendance records |
| Progress Note | Stores care notes and service observations |
| Incident Report | Stores reported incidents and supporting evidence |
| Invoice | Stores billing records generated for services |
| Funding Budget | Stores NDIS funding allocation and usage details |
| Notification | Stores alerts and reminders for users |
| Audit Log | Stores important system actions for security and compliance |
| Consent Record | Stores participant consent and privacy approvals |

---

# 6. REST API Design

## 6.1 API Design Approach
The application uses a **REST API architecture** to allow the mobile frontend to communicate with backend services. REST APIs are appropriate because they are simple, scalable, easy to integrate, and widely supported across mobile and web platforms.

Each major module has its own endpoint group. These APIs are designed to:
- create records
- retrieve records
- update records
- delete or deactivate records
- support secure access control
- enable smooth communication between frontend and backend

# 7. Validation Rules

## 7.1 Validation Purpose
Validation ensures that the data entered into the system is complete, accurate, secure, and logically correct. It reduces system errors, improves reliability, and protects sensitive participant and provider information.

Validation should be applied at both:
- frontend level for user guidance
- backend level for security and data integrity

---

## 7.2 General Validation Rules
The system should enforce the following general rules:

- Required fields must not be left empty
- IDs must be valid and unique
- Email addresses must follow a valid format
- Dates must be valid and logically correct
- Numeric values must not be negative unless explicitly allowed
- Uploaded files must meet file type and size limits
- Input lengths should be controlled to prevent invalid or harmful data
- Only authorised users should access protected functions

---

## 7.3 Entity-Specific Validation

### User Validation
- first_name is required
- last_name is required
- email is required and must be unique
- password must meet strength requirements
- role_id must refer to a valid role
- organisation_id must refer to a valid organisation

### Participant Validation
- first_name is required
- last_name is required
- ndis_number is required and must be unique
- date_of_birth must be valid
- emergency_contact is required
- organisation_id must be valid

### Shift Validation
- participant_id must exist
- user_id must exist
- shift_start is required
- shift_end is required
- shift_end must be later than shift_start
- check_out_time cannot be earlier than check_in_time

### Progress Note Validation
- participant_id must exist
- user_id must exist
- note_text must not be empty
- only authorised roles can create or edit notes

### Incident Report Validation
- participant_id must exist
- user_id must exist
- incident_date is required
- description is required
- severity must match allowed values
- evidence file must meet allowed file rules

### Invoice Validation
- participant_id must exist
- amount must be greater than zero
- invoice_date is required
- payment_status must match defined values

### Funding Budget Validation
- allocated_amount must not be negative
- used_amount must not be negative
- remaining_amount should be calculated correctly

---

# 8. Security and Technical Considerations
The backend design should also support security and compliance requirements.

### Important considerations
- Use **JWT authentication** for session security
- Support **two-factor authentication** for sensitive user access
- Apply **role-based access control (RBAC)**
- Use **HTTPS/TLS** for secure data transmission
- Store uploaded evidence files securely
- Record important activities in the **Audit Log**
- Protect sensitive participant information with access restrictions
- Validate all incoming API requests before database actions

---

# 9. Summary
In Week 5, the backend structure for the GridLink NDIS application was defined through the design of the **database schema**, **REST APIs**, and **validation rules**. The main entities, their relationships, and required APIs were identified to support participant management, scheduling, care documentation, incident handling, billing, notifications, and reporting. The included diagrams provide a clear visual explanation of how the data model and API structure work together to support the application.

This deliverable forms a strong foundation for future backend development and implementation.
